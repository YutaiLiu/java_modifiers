//                          Field&Method modifier (member level):
//                  public, protected, "no modifier", default, private, static, final
//public: field can be accessed to all classes, no getter and setter method needed
            // careful to use, cause it's easy to be changed
//protected: access level lower than publicï¼Œspecifies that
            // the member can only be accessed within its own package (as with package-private)
            // and, in addition, by a subclass of its class in another package.
//"no modifier declared": access level lower than protected, like "package-private",
            // can not be access from other package
//private: field can be only accessed in its class, can only access with getter and setter from outside
            // most of time you should define most variable as private, unless you have good reason not to
            //*** private method can not be overridden ***
//static: also known as "class level", you can define class variable and class method with this modifier
            // class variable: computer will only store one copy in memory, you even do not need an obj exist
                            // all instantiated class obj will share to use it, save your RAM
                            // you should define common message as static variable
                            // because they won't be different between different obj, like GardenFrog.color
                            // the right way to use class variable is: ClassName.StaticVariable
            // class method: "static method" or "public static method"
                            //do not need to instantiate first
                            //can only access class variable and class method
                            //can't access instance variable or instance method because they must use an object reference.
                            // Also, class methods cannot use the "this" keyword as there is no instance for "this" to refer to.
                            //*** class method can not be overridden ***
//final: also known as "content variable", will work with static at the same time, like "static final double PI = 3.1415926"
            //final variable has to be initialized at the first second, and behavior like constant variable, immutable
            //***final method can not be overridden***

//                          Class modifier (top-level):
//                  public, default, final
//public class: can be extended in other packages, reachable out of package
//"no modifier" class (no modifier declared): package-private class
//final class: class can not be inherited
//So does interface

                            //Abstract Class & Interface
//As upper level concept, you can use abstract class or interface to represent
//the difference between logic of abstract class and interface is:
//abstract class represent a "... is ..." logic, e.g. Fly is Animal, so Animal could be abstract class and Fly should extend it
//interface represent s "... like ..." logic, e.g. Fly like airplane, then airplane could be designed as an interface and left Fly implement it

//the main differences between abstract class and non-abstract class are
//1. abstract could contain abstract method, non-abstract class couldn't
//2. abstract can not be instantiated

//Interface has an special method since Java8, default method, which can be overridden by sub-class or sub-interfaces
        // If there are interfaces A and B implement two default method share same return type, same name and same parameter
        // class C or interface C which implement or extend A and B at the same time, has to override that method to avoid clash
        // if parameter is different there won't be a clash,
        // if two method have different return type, there is not way to solve, you can not override separately
        // You can differentiate them by InterfaceA.super.MethodName() and InterfaceB.super.MethodName()
//Things interface could contain: fields, static method, default method, public abstract method
//Things interface couldn't contain: state (obj variable, because interface can not be instantiated),
        // constructor (because no state), non-abstract and non-static or default method

                            // Class Heritage
// A class can inherit from upper level in these combinations:
// 1. extend one super-class
// 2. extend one super-class and implement one or multiple interfaces
// 3. extend one abstract class
// 4. extend one abstract class and implement one or multiple interfaces
// 5. implement one or multiple interfaces
// As a sub-level class, it can only extend one abstract or non-abstract super-class,
// but could implement one or multiple interfaces
// As a sub-level interface, it can extend one or multiple interfaces
// A special case: Nested class
    // a class nested in another class called nested class, to be even more special, it could be static
    // a static nested class is called static nested class, which can only access static member
    // otherwise it is called inner class, which can access all members include private member
    // (cause inner class is also part of outer class)

class main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        //Because Animal, Frog and Fly are abstract classes, to instantiate it
        //You must extend them as a non-abstract class, like GardenFrog and DomesticFly

        // Because you define obj firstFrog and firstFly as an Animal reference
        // you can only access the methods in Animal class
